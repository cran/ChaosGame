\title{
Plot the 3D fractal containing the chosen word 
}
\description{
The function allows to enter a word of at least two letters based on which an Iterated Function System with Probabilities (IFSP) is constructed. This IFSP is then used to generate a two-dimensional fractal containing the chosen word infinitely often, which is then projected onto several three-dimensional surfaces. Optionally, the projection is transformed into another fractal with uniform marginals.
}
\usage{
plot_word3D(word = "copula", R = 20, plot.rgl = TRUE, 
           copula = TRUE, portion = 0.2, color.rgl.plot = "green2magenta",
           plot.surface = "Sphere", histogram = TRUE, shift = 1.2, 
           orbit = 3000, cex.label = 0.7, size.lines = 0.1,
           Theta = 40, Phi = 30, Box = TRUE, projection = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{word}{
Word which the fractal should contain infinitely often.
}
  \item{R}{
Number of runs of the chaos game. 
}
  \item{plot.rgl}{
If \code{plot.rgl = TRUE} a rgl-plot is generated. Otherwise a scatter-plot with plot3D is produced.
}
  \item{copula}{
If \code{copula = TRUE} the sample is (approximately) probability-integral-transformed. 
}
  \item{portion}{
Portion based on which the empirical distribution functions are calculated, if \code{copula = TRUE}.
}
  \item{color.rgl.plot}{
Plotting color/color-range for the rgl-plot. One can choose between \code{"gray"}, \code{"blue2green"}, \code{"green2red"}, \code{"blue2yellow"}, \code{"ygobb"},  \code{"magenta2green"} and \code{"green2magenta"}. 
}
  \item{plot.surface}{
Three-dimensional surface on which the two-dimensional fractal is projected. Options are \code{"Sphere"}, \code{"Helix"}, \code{"Torus"}, \code{"EnneperMinimalSurface"} and \code{"CatalanSurface"}. 
}
  \item{histogram}{
It is an option available only under the rgl-plot option (i.e if \code{plot.rgl = TRUE}).
If \code{histogram = TRUE}, two-dimensional and one-dimensional marginal histograms are plotted in the rgl-plot.
}
  \item{shift}{
Distance between letters. 
}
  \item{orbit}{
Number of steps in each run of the chaos game.  
}
  \item{cex.label}{
Font size, for exporting as a pdf or png file (see examples).
}
  \item{size.lines}{
Line width, for exporting as a pdf or png file (see examples).  
}
  \item{Theta, Phi}{
Angles defining the viewing direction. \code{Theta} gives the azimuthal direction
and \code{Phi} the colatitude in the scatter-plot (see Package plot3D). Can be chosen only under the scatter-plot option (i.e if \code{plot.rgl = FALSE}).
}
\item{Box}{
If \code{TRUE}, axis, two-dimensional projections (if \code{projection = TRUE}) and marginal histograms are plotted.
}
\item{projection}{
An option available only if \code{Box = TRUE}.
If \code{projection = TRUE}, the two-dimensional projections are plotted together with axis and marginal histograms.
