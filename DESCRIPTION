Description: The main objective of the package is to enter a word of at least two letters based on which an Iterated Function System with Probabilities is constructed, and a two-dimensional fractal containing the chosen word infinitely often is generated via the Chaos Game. Additionally, the package allows to project the two-dimensional fractal on several three-dimensional surfaces and to transform the fractal into another fractal with uniform marginals.
